# Social Links Profile

This is my solution to the [Social links profile challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/social-links-profile-UG32l9m6dQ). This project helped me improve my HTML and CSS skills by building a responsive social profile card.

## Overview

- Users can see hover and focus states on all interactive buttons.
- The layout is mobile-first and adapts to desktop screens.
- Colors and fonts follow the Frontend Mentor style guide.
